    "# Parallel is All You Want: Speech Emotion Recognition with Parallel CNNs and Transformer-Encoders\n",
    "# Abstract\n",
    "In this notebook, I'm going to build upon my [Intro to Speech Audio Classification repo](https://github.com/IliaZenkov/sklearn-audio-classification) and build two stacked convolutional neural networks (CNN) in parallel with a Transformer encoder network to classify audio data. We're working on the [RAVDESS dataset](https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/) to classify emotions from one of 8 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to try to harness the image-classification power of the CNN by treating mel spectrograms as grayscale images; their width is a time scale, their height is a frequency scale The value of each pixel in the mel spectrogram is the intensity of the audio signal at a particular mel frequency at a time step. Because of the sequential nature of the data, we will also use the Transformer to try and model as accurately as possible the temporal relationships between pitch transitions in emotions. I additionally use Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to augment the RAVDESS dataset three-fold for a total of 4320 audio samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes inspirations from a variety of recent advances in deep learning and network architectures; in particular, stacked and parallel CNN networks combined with multi-head self-attention layers from the Transformer Encoder. I hypothesize that the expansion of CNN filter channel dimensions and reduction of feature maps will provide the most expressive feature representation at the lowest computaitonal cost, while the Transformer-Encoder is used with the hypothesis that the network will learn to predict frequency distributions of different emotions according to the global structure of the mel spectrogram of each emotion. **With the strength of the CNN in image classification and Transformer in sequence encoding, I manage to achieve a 97.01% accuracy on a test set from the RAVDESS dataset.**\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "From my previous notebook: \"Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent DNN candidates for audio data classification: LSTM RNNs because of their excellent ability to interpret sequential data such as features of the audio waveform represented as a time series; CNNs because features engineered on audio data such as spectrograms have marked resemblance to images, in which CNNs excel at recognizing and discriminating between distinct patterns.\" - Me \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to build on that - CNNs are still the hallmark of image classification today, although even in this domain Transformers are beginning to take the main stage: A [2021 ICLR submission: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy) claims they've implemented a Transformer for image classification that outperforms a state of the art CNN, and at a much lower computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to taking inspiration from the above, it's also no longer 2015 - so instead of the LSTM-RNN I'm going to implement its successor the Transformer model in parallel with a CNN to try and get state-of-the-art performance on the RAVDESS dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other motivations for the architecture of this model come from a variety of papers from the past few years. **The most notable inspirations are:**\n",

    "## Augmenting the Data: Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our dataset is small, it is prone to overfitting - especially with highly parameterized deep neural net models\n",
    "such as the one we aim to build in this notebook. As such, we're going to want to augment our data. Generating more real samples will be immensely difficult. Instead, we can add white noise to the audio signals - not only to mask the effect of random noise present in the training set - but also **to create pseudo-new training samples and offset the impact of noise intrinsic to the dataset.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the RAVDESS dataset is extremely clean - we will likely want to make predictions on noisy, real-world data - yet another reason to augment the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). It's Additive because we're adding it to the source audio signal,\n",
    "**it's Gaussian because the noise vector will be sampled from a normal distribution and have a time average of zero (zero-mean), and it's white because after a whitening transformation the noise will add power to the audio signal uniformly across the frequency distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a good balance of noise - too little will be useless, and too much will make it too difficult for the network to learn from the training data. **Note that this is just for training - we would _not_ need to add AWGN to real-world data on which we make predictions** (although we could). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Math\n",
    "The key parameters in AWGN are the signal to noise ratio (SNR), defining the magnitude of the noise added w.r.t. the audio signal. We parameterize AWGN with the minimum and maximize SNR so we can pick a random SNR to use in augmenting each sample's waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to constrain covariance to make it true AWGN. **We make a zero-mean vector of Gaussian noises (np.random.normal) that are statistically dependent. We need to apply a [whitening transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_transformation)**, a linear transformation taking a vector of random normal (Gaussian) variables with a known covariance matrix and mapping it to a new vector whose covariance is the identity matrix, i.e. the vector is now perfectly uncorrelated with a diaganol covariance matrix, each point of noise having variance == stdev == 1. **The whitening transformation by definition transforms a vector into a white noise vector.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to add the AWGN augmented waveforms as new samples to our dataset. **Since we generate AWGN which is random for each and every sample - random random noise - we can add multiples of our noise-augmented dataset. I'll add 2 extra identical, randomly noisy datasets with 1440 samples each to get a dataset with 1440 native + 1440x2 == 4320 noisy samples.**"

    "# Architecture Overview\n",
    "As a whole, the CNN architecture of this network is inspired by a combination of the golden standards in image and sequence processing over the last few years: \n",
    "\n",
    "Each 3-layer deep 2D convolutional block is extremely similar to the **classic [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) architecture: Conv->Pool>Conv>Pool>FC.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**[AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) forms the basis for increasing the complexity of feature maps with channel expansion through stacked CNN layers; [Inception and GoogLeNet](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43022.pdf) are the inspiration for parallelizing CNN layers in the hopes of diverisfying the features learned by the network.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**[VGGNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) proved the unreasonable efficiency of using fixed sized kernels throughout deeply stacked CNN layers;** I found this to extend to this task. Specifically, VGG saw an improvement over AlexNet largely by replacing large kernels (i.e. 11x11 stride 5) with smaller ones of 3x3 stride 1. One of the motivations that VGG cites for this is that the 3x3 kernel is the smallest kernel size choice in understanding spatial data w.r.t. up/down/left/right (although VGG also uses 1x1 kernels). VGGNet also inspires the maxpool kernel size of 2x2 stride 2, as I have used at the first layer of each convolutional block. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise, the motivation to use small stacked filters is two-fold: Computational efficiency and expressivity of feature representation. When we stack 3 3x3 kernels on top of eachother as in this architecture, the second layer has a 5x5 view of the original input volume, and the 3rd layer a 7x7 view. However, the nonlinearities between each smaller layer convey more complex feature representations, whereas a single 7x7 layer would only perform a linear transformation itself. Furthermore, if we keep channel (C) consistent between layers, then 3 3x3 kernels are parameterized by (3(C(3x3xC)) = 27C^2 parameters, while just one 7x7 kernel needs C(7x7xC) = 49C^2 parameters. **Ultimately, small stacked kernels appear to be both more powerful and efficient - although, in [Large Kernel Matters -\n",
    "Improve Semantic Segmentation by Global Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02719.pdf), the authors conclude that a larger kernel outperforms smaller stacked kernels for semantic segmentation - however, since we are just doing the semantic part (classification) and don't care about \"where\" the emotion is - this shouldn't apply.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the original [2015 Batch Normalization (BN) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) suggests that \"We add the BN transform immediately before the nonlinearity\" i.e. before ReLU; however, **I achieved better performance out of this architechture using BN after ReLU. See Keras author's [Francois Chollet's response on GitHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/1802#issuecomment-187966878) regarding the BN order issue: \"I can guarantee that recent code written by Christian \\[Szegedy\\] applies relu before BN\".** \n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture is precisely as in Viswani et al, 2017: Attention is All You Need, but I use 4 stacked encoders instead of 6 as in their paper. For more details on the Transformer block: [Appendix B: The Transformer and Self-Attention (is All You Need)](#Appendix-B:-The-Transformer-and-Self-Attention-(is-All-You-Need))\n",
    "\n",
    "# CNN Motivation\n",
    "**CNNs with 2D convolutional layers are the gold standard for image processing**, other than the recent advances in the Transformer for images. 2D convolution layers accept input feature maps in a (N,C,H,W) (batch size, channel, height, width) format. We have 4320 mels - 1440 native and 2880 noise augmented - each mel is of shape 128x563 representing 128 mel frequency bands with 563 timesteps each. **We can imagine mel spectrograms to be a black and white image with 1 signal (colour) intensity channel.** Our mel spectrogram input feature tensor will thus be of shape (4320, 1, 128, 563). I'm going to refer to input/output feature maps and input/output volumes interchangeably, but they have the same meaning. After an activation function operates on a feature map, it produces an activation map.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using 3x3 kernels in all 3 layers in both CNN blocks. The first layer only has a single input channel creating a 1x3x3 filter. The next layer has 16 input channels and 32 output channels , producing 32 unique 16x3x3 filters, *each* filter having 16x3x3 = 144 weights. The second layer is applying 32 differently weighted 16x3x3 filters to an input volume of 16x64x281 (the 2x2 maxpooled output of the first layer), producing an output feature map of 32x8x35 after 8x8 stride 8 maxpooling. The last layer has 32 input channels, so a 32x3x3 filter, and 64 output channels, so 64 unique such filters. The last layer produces an output feature map of 64x1x4 after 8x8 stride 4 maxpooling. **In sum, I hope that the expansion of filter dimensions and reduction of feature maps provides the most expressive feature representation at the lowest computaitonal cost.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**The key motivations and operations of a 2D Convolutional Neural Net are described in detail in [Appendix A: Convolutional Neural Nets Dissected](#Appendix-A:-Convolutional-Neural-Nets-Dissected) in order to explain the motivation behind the necessity of the CNN for this task and the considerations to take when optimizing the hyperparameters of each layer in a CNN.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transformer-Encoder Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**I use the Transformer-Encoder layer as introduced in [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) with the hopes that the network will learn to predict frequency distributions of different emotions according to the global structure of the mel spectrogram of each emotion.** I could have used LSTM-RNNs to learn the sequence of the spectrogram for each emotion, but the network would only learn to predict frequency changes according to adjacent time steps; in contrast, the multi-head self-attention layers of the transformer enable the network to look at multiple previous time steps when predicting the next. This made sense to me because emotions colour the entire sequence of frequencies, not just at one timestep. \n",

    "## Kernels and Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of the behaviour of each convoluitional layer is its kernels. Each convolutional layer is made of a certain number of 2D kernels whose dimensions we specify .**A stack of 2D kernels in a layer create the 3D filters defining the operation of that layer on its input feature map (a tensor). Each filter contains a number of weights equal to its size (i.e. depth x height x width).** The kernel's size is a hyperparameter of the convolutional layer; the kernel's receptive field. It is so named because **the kernel's size determines the dimensions of the input feature map it sees during each convoluton.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Even though complete CNN filters are 3D, they are only moved by their stride length in the H x W dimensions and encompass the entire depth of the feature map over which they operate - so the convolution is actually 2D, hence the nomenclature.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/convolutional layer stanford.gif\" width=400 height=400 />\n",
    "<center><sub>Visualization of a single 3x3 stride 1 kernel's convolution with a 5x5 feautre map. Figure from Stanford Deep Learning Tutorial: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/FeatureExtractionUsingConvolution/\n",
    "</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing a convolution, we take the products of the kernel's weights with the values of the input feature map and sum them to create a single entry in the output feature map. In this task, the initial input feature map has values describing pixel brightness - in our case, **we have 128x563 \"spectrogram pixels\", each pixel representing the intensity in decibels of each of 128 mel frequencies at each of 563 time points - in other words, we have a 128x563 grayscale image map with just one channel for brightness, which is why a CNN is a first-choice model for the task.**  Each kernel constituting a convolutional layer's filter creates a single 2D feature map - and so **more kernels = larger filters = more 2D feature maps = higher complexity (depth) 3D feature maps, where the # of kernels is specified by a layer's input channel.** If our input feature map has 1 channel and 2D dimensions H x W and we want 16 output channels, we'll have 1 2D kernel in that layer's filter and produce 16 2D feature maps of H x W, or a single 3D 16 x H x W feature map for the entire layer. **A higher output channel dimension creates a larger quantity of output feature maps. This may be beneficial or detrimental w.r.t. overfitting depending on the task.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For every input channel we have one 2D kernel, so when we have multiple input channels we have a collection of 2D kernels making up a 3D filter. Each 2D kernel creates a single 2D contribution to each output channel - so the entire 3D filter creates one entire 3D output channel. In this architecture, and as is standard for stacked CNNs, we expand the complexity of the input feature map in the channel/depth dimension while keeping constant its H x W dimensions. Each 3D filter is passed over the input feature map once for every complete output channel. The number of input channels determines the number of 2D kernels and thus, the *size of all 3D filters* in a layer, while the number of output channels determines *how many 3D filters* are passed over the input feature map - the convolution of all input feature maps with unique 3D filter creates one unique output channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To summarize, the input channel dimension determines the *size of all 3D filters* in that layer, while the output channel dimension determines the *number of unique 3D filters* in that layer. Each filter is defined by a unique set of weights, and each filter has its own bias term.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/filter weights.png\" width=700 height=700 />\n",
    "<center><sub>A collection of 2D kernels makes up a conolutional layer's 3D filters: each filter has a unique set of weights, visualized here. The Kernel size is FxF and Depth is C (Channel dimension). Figure from Stanford's CS230: https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-convolutional-neural-networks\n",
    "</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each filter in a layer learns to produce a high-magnitude activation (after ReLU) when encountering a feature which it has learned to represent. Each filter outputs creates a unique feature map. In performant CNNs, the filters in each convolutional layer are likely to learn a different set of high-level features, in a hierarchical manner of increasing complexity with each subsequent convolutional layer as we expand the channel dimension. The idea behind this paradigm is to create higher-order feature representations akin to the way humans recognize images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Touching on the neuron representation of a CNN, **every element of a 3D output volume can be seen as the activation of a neuron that looks at a small region in the input volume.** Every neuron in a filter shares parameters with all neurons to the left and right of it spatially because the parameters are updated for these neurons by applying that same filter. **In this way, the neurons of a CNN are only locally connected in contrast to the fully connected \"dense\" layer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To be succint: A CNN layer transforms a 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. Classification itself is only done by subsequent non-convolutional layers, usually with fully connected linear layers.**\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## Zero Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "We zero pad the input feature map at the start of each convolutional block, i.e. add a column and row of zeroes to each side of the feature map's (H,W) dimension. **If we don't zero-pad before each convolutional layer then the input feature map is producing only 'valid' convolutions with the filters; after each full convolution the size of the output feature map would reduce by a small amount: The information at the borders will gradually erode.** If a kernel's next stride will set it to be out of bounds of the last column of the (H,W) dimensions of the feature map, that convolution would not be valid; the kernel will proceed (take a step of length==stride) down to the next row. If our kernel sizes is > 1 and stride length is > 1, this means we will completely lose features at the right and bottom edge of our feature map. Zero padding is standard in convolutional layers for kernel sizes > 1, even with a stride of 1 - if we don't pad in this case, corner pixels (features) will only be used once. **Because all convolutional kernels in this network are 3x3 stride 1; I zero-pad 1 to preserve the input dimensions of the feature map at each convolutional layer, i.e. 'same' zero-padding.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Max Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the real magic happens. Maxpool kernels operate on a feature map much like convolutional kernels; however, they perform no multiplication or addition, but rather a simple argmax operation taking the highest valued feature in the maxpool kernel's receptive field; In this way, maxpool layers reduce the dimensions of the feature maps (volumes) upon which they operate. Maxpooling can be equivalently seen as a dimensionality reduction, or down-sampling technique for features spaces. **Ultimately, maxpooling drastically reduces the numer of parameters a network must learn**; there are much fewer connections between subsequent layers than there would be without maxpooling. **Maxpooling is precisely what makes CNNs practical.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, maxpooling outputs a feature map that contains only the most important features in each region of an input feature map, and puts these features in context of their position relative to the other most important features. Here's an extremely suitable analogy not far from what happens under the hood: **An eye near a nose near a mouth probably means a face - doesn't matter the position of the eye, it just matters that it's adjacent to the nose, and the nose to the mouth. Because of this paradigm, CNNs are extremely good at recognizing images even when rotated or shifted: that is, CNNs are feature and scale invariant. Note, however, that features themselves learned by CNNs are *not* scale or rotation invariant.** Again, and perhaps even moreso in this way, maxpooling is the absolute core of a CNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/maxpool gif.png\" width=500 height=500 />\n",
    "<center><sub>Visualization of a maxpool layer from Stanford's CS230: https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-convolutional-neural-networks\n",
    "</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**To extend the above to this application: A sharp pitch transition from one mel frequency band to another could represent an angry voice, doesn't matter at what point in time the transition happens (shift invariance). This is precisely what we need to get the generalizability we want.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this architecture I use non-overlapping maxpool kernels, reducing an input volume by the kernel size: **Using a 2x2 maxpool kernel takes 1/4 pixels in its receptive field, so it reduces the amount of information contained in its output volume by 75%.** The first layer has a 128x563 input volume = 72,064 pixels; after 2x2 maxpooling this becomes a 64x281 output volume = 17,984 pixels. 17,984/72,064 = 1/4. **While the dimensions of the volume are reduced the *dimensions* of the kernel, the total amount of information in the volume is reduced by the *size* of the kernel.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The typical maxpool kernel on a first convolutional layer in stacked architecture such as AlexNet and GoogLeNet is 2x2 with stride 1.** A higher stride length throws away more information and a smaller stride length retains more, since they will take less or more steps over the input volume depending on their stride length, less so on their size. Some prominent networks (AlexNet, GoogLeNet) use 3x3 kernels with stride length 2 for their maxpooling layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "I optimized the kernel size and stride on the principal of finding a perfect balance between feature retention at each layer of the network and feature reduction to make the model computationally reasonable. **I found that a 2x2 stride 2 non-overlapping maxpool kernel - a 1/4 feature map reduction - was necessary on the input layer to retain a decent balance of features going through subsequent convolutional layers, but thereafter a non-overlapping 8x8, stride 8 kernel - a 1/16 feature map reduction - provided an excellent computation boost on the next 2 layers with little trade-off in accuracy.**\n",
    " \n",
    "**In practice, my final network architecture ended up to be that of VGGNet: 3x3 stride 1 convolutional kernels with 2x2 stride 2 maxpool kernels - with the distinction of 8x8 stride 8 maxpool kernels after the first convolutional layer out of computational necessity - I could not afford 138M parameters :).**\n",

    "## Regularization Using Dropout (and a note on Pruning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry in a 3D activaiton map is akin to the activation of a neuron.  **When passing an activation map through a dropout layer, we simply deactivate a number of those neurons (activations); neurons to be dropped are selected from a Bernoulli distribution with probability _p_ to be zeroed (deactivated.** In this network we implement dropout of 30% of features at the end of each 2D convolutional layer after maxpooling the ReLU transformed activation maps. As in section 5.2 of [the dropout paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580), the **weights learned in training must be scaled by a factor 1/(1-p) so that the weights are not inflated for those activations that are kept; this is necessary so the same network is performant without dropout on test data.** In essence, we keep the sum of the weights the same when using dropout, so we produce the same expected value of activations  independent of dropout probability - otherwise the activaitons from the kept neurons would cause incorrect weights to be learned. Dropout is applicable to a wide variety of neural net architectures. Think of it as kind of a \"weight loss\" for your network, pun intended - **making not only for faster training, but also reducing the co-dependence between learned features. Note that we turn off dropout (i.e. we keep all learned neurons) during validation and testing.** \n",

    "</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to indeed turn off certain neurons during validation and training, that would no longer be considered dropout - that would be pruning, where we look for and remove all connections with \"dead\" neurons - those with little contribution or otherwise undesirable contributions to the network. When we perform pruning on a network, we would be removing certain clusters of neurons - feature representations, i.e. filters from a CNN. **There's been some recent progress in the field of CNN pruning with some pretty exciting results - for example, a [60% reduction in network parameters with a 0.6% accuracy loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08142).** I achieved very reasonable training times (~10 mins) so I spent more time on tuning than pruning.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Batch Normalization and Optimizing the Optimization Landsape \n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the activation map input to each convolutional layer change as the network is trained because the previous layer's output changes as its parameters are adjusted - the authors of [the batch normalization paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) term this \"internal covariate shift\". Non saturating nonlinearities (such as ReLU) are highly affected by weights of higher magnitude while saturating nonlinearities (sigmoid, tanh) may make a model slower to train. **Because the differential of a saturating nonlinear activation for outputs beyond +-1 approaches 0, the error differential between such outputs also approaches zero, meaning no change to backpropogation for such outputs - i.e. we encounter a variation of the vanishing gradient problem with saturing nonlinear activations.** Batch normalization re-centers the data, making it more likely that activation maps will belong to similar distributions throughout training. More specifically, **batch normalization encourages each layer's neurons to produce outputs closer to the linear regions of their activation**, i.e. attempts to center the activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As activation map distributions change, the loss surface of the optimizer becomes more volatile; the loss surface is defined for  settings of the weights, which will be updated in unpredictable ways on unstable activation maps. As such, lower learning rates are usually needed to ensure weights are moved in the direction of a more stable negative gradient, otherwise an optimizer is more likely to converge on suboptimal solutions before proper model parameters are learned. **Though input feature maps may be initially scaled to have zero mean and unit variance, once they are output as activations of a subsequent hidden layer different features sets may transform to belong to different distributions.** Proper parameter initialization is also important to consider in avoiding suboptimal convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch normalization ultimately results in faster convergence by steering a model away from becoming stuck in a saturated learning regime with a vanishing gradient.** Batch normalization also encourages regularized weights in this way, discouraging exploding gradients and overfitting. This normalization is implemented internally as an aspect of the model's architecture, so the output from each training minibatch is normalized at each layer. Since this mitigates the issue of internal covariate shift, **the network can be initialized with a broader range of parameters and a higher learning rate, and still achieve optimal convergenec.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper shows BN works this empirically instead of with a mathematical proof - which is perhaps why some disagree with the reasoning behind BN: In [How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?,](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11604.pdf) the authors argue that the stabilziation of the internal covariate shift is not the main factor behind BN's success, but rather **it is smoothing of the optimizer's loss function landscape that improves performance**. A smoother loss surface creates a more stable direction of the gradient differential between each training step i.e. moving towards a good minima; te gradients are more predictable leading to faster training since we can use higher learning rates when the gradient moves predictably in the direction of a global minima. We would otherwise need more frequent recalculation of the gradient in a region to make sure we move in the right direciton. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In short, the default behaviour of batch norm and as it is implemented in pytorch is essentially applying standard scaling (zero-mean, unit variance) to the tensor's minibatch (H,W) dimension.**  \n",

    "## ReLU: Non-Saturated Activations are Healthier (for CNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using ReLU for activation, as is standard in CNNs to avoid saturation of weights - large weights aren't squashed so we  further discourage a vanishing gradient. **This model would take much longer to train with tanh/sigmoid with negligible performance differences.** This is especially important due to the moderate depth of this model, because with a saturating nonlinear activation we would have increasing difficulty trainig subsequent layers. We want a decent amount of layers to learn a higher representation of features, e.g. not just frequency transitions but the shape and magnitude of these transitions with respect to one another. The gradient is usually high if a neuron is activated with ReLU, producing effective successive gradients in the network, while sigmoid and tanh activations produce near-zero gradients for very high magnitude inputs. All in all, ReLU will lead to much faster convergence and for this task produces excellent results. \n",

    "## Turning Feature Maps into Probabilities with a Fully Connected Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, CNNs cannot perform classification themselves. Regular hidden layers operate only on 1D arrays, while convolutional layers produce 3D activation maps. As such, the entire volume of the 3D activation map is flattened to a 1D array so it can be connected to all input neurons in the next fully connected (FC) layer, thusly termed. Using a fully connected layer at the end of convolutional layers to enable classification is a standard architechture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this network, we have an output embedding from each convolutional block of 64x1x4 = 256, and an output embedding from the Transformer block of 1x64.

We can learn all we need about self-attention from the Transformer paper. **Scroll past the wall of text to see a block-by-block breakdown of the Transformer with images.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer, Introduced in [Attention is All you Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et all in 2017, the Transformer model replaces the seq2seq LSTM-RNN model with intra-attention described above by introducing the self-Attention mechanism as it is used now. **Instead of using LSTM-RNNs with attention layer-aligned context vectors, the Transformer implements multiple self-attention mechanisms and does away completely with LSMT-RNNs for seq2seq tasks.** Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture encodes an input sequence's context vectors as a set of (K, V) key-value pairs with the same dimension as the input sequence length. **Now, both the keys (inputs) and values (inputs' hidden states) comprise the encoder's hidden states. The output predicted at the previous timestep by the decoder is computed into a \"query\", and the next term in the decoder's output sequence is a mapping from the key-val pairs plus query: (Q,K,V)** Each output term of the decoder is a weighted sum of all values from the (K,V) encoded representation of an input - so, like a regular attention mechanism \n",
    "which decodes a weighted sum of hidden states, but self-attention assigns the (alignment) weights to each value (hidden state) as a sequence-length-scaled dot-product of the query with all the keys. **That is, the weighted sum of all the inputs' hidden states are computed w.r.t. the previous (last) term in the output sequence and the entire input sequence.** This is where the global attention ability of the Transformer originates. \n",

In this way, multi-headed (multi-layer) self-attention can compute a term in the output sequence weighted differently according to a region (subspace) of the input sequence.** Intuitively: In the sentence \"I like sour green \\_\\_\\_\", one attention head will learn weights more densely towards the term \"sour\" in the input sequence, and another will learn weights more densely towards \"green\". **Each attention head in multi-headed self-attention still computes a scaled dot product over the entire (K,V) encoded input, just weighted differently w.r.t. the input values.**\n",

    "## Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the autoencoder - the basis for RNNs and seq2seq models, which the Transformer replaces, will help get a better understanding of the motivation and operations behind the Transformer architecture.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders essentially try to learn a function F(weight, bias, X) = X. It's trying to output a sequence similar to the one input. This becomes difficult when we give this task to a network constrained by a limited number of hidden neurons - that is,\n",
    "there isn't a single neuron in the encoder for every data point in X. Therefore, an encoder needs to learn a compressed representation of the inputs it is trained on. For example, Reconstructing a 100-pixel 10x10 image using 50 hidden neurons. \n",
    "For an autoencoder to be effective, there must be structure - correlation - between the points of the data which we wish to process with an autoencoder. The constraint recquiring an encoder to learn a compressed representation is also called the 'bottleneck'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/autoencoder.png\" width=png height=650 />\n",
    "<center><sub>Standard/Vanilla Autoencoder, figure by Deepak Birla: https://medium.com/@birla.deepak26/autoencoders-76bb49ae6a8f</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are in fact quite similar to PCA which, in a way, encodes the structure of data it operates upon by computing eigenvectors of a covariance matrix such that projecting points along the principal component axes produces vectors encoding the greatest amount of variance (information) in fewer dimensions than available in the input data. In contrast to the autoencoder, the components produced by PCA are linear combinations of the original data. This has the advantage of producing fast and interpretable transformations, but the disadvantage of being incapable of encoding nonlinear relationships between features. **In this sense, an autoencoder is sort of an upgraded PCA - it too can perform dimensionality reuidction, but with the added ability to learn nonlinear representations of features - at the sacrifice of interpretability and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Sparse Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse autoencoders extend the constraints of encoding beyond number of hidden neurons - we may choose more hidden neurons than input data points, instead imposing the sparsity constraint, adding an extra penalty term to our loss function. We parameterize the penalty term with a sparsity parameter close to 0 for ReLU and sigmoid activations,  close to -1 for tanh: i.e. inactive. I'll refer to 0 as an inactive neuron herein. **The objective of sparse autoencoding is to force the average activation of all hidden neurons to be lower than the sparsity parameter: most neurons in the hidden layer will not activate for any given set of features.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sparsity constraint or, penalty term, whichever way we refer to it, is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence: a function \n",
    "which computes the divergence between two Bernoulli random variables, i.e. in a distribution of 0 or 1. **A KL divergence penalty, the regularization term of an autoencoder, blows up when the average activation of hidden neurons in a particular layer are not near the penalty constraint _p_ - and so the average activation of the hidden layer is forced to be neither 0 nor 1, but close to _p=~0_, e.g. 0.05.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder layers of sparse autoencoders are trained with a loss function  - the \"reconstruction term\" - which optimizes the precise reconstruction of an input, usually with mean square (MSE) loss. Ultimately, the result is that unless a neuron's activation on a particular set of input features seriously blows up the loss for the resulting reconstruction, then that neuron will be parameterized to reduce its activation to 0 for that input. **A sparse autoencoder's neuron will only learn a high activation on an input feature set if it is critical to accuracy of the model.** As such, a model benefits from sparse autoencoding in that each neuron of the hidden layer activates if, and only if it is given as input the precise feature which it has learned to represent. This has the inherent benefit of harshly penalizing overfit models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Variational Autoencoder, Decoders, and Latent Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The vanilla autoencoder computes a feature representation called the latent space, in analogy to the principal components of PCA. Once an input feature set is encoded into a latent space, several more hidden layers called **decoder layers have the objective to reconstruct the input feature set from the encoded latent space.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Since autoencoders seek to produce outputs similar to their inputs, autoencoders are a flavour of generative model - although **vanilla autoencoders cannot generate output they have never seen. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are more appropriate to that task. In contrast to a single point in the latent space encoded by a vanilla autoencoder, VAEs instead compute a distribution of the latent space of their input.** We can then sample points from an input's latent space distribution to truly generate new output data.\n",

    "<center><sub>Variational Autoencoder, figure by Katsunori Ohnishi: http://katsunoriohnishi.github.io/</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the sparse autoencoder, we have the **KL divergence in the latent (encoding) layer(s),\n",
    "now constraining  the latent representation to be close to standard normal distributions, and the reconstruction term on decoding layers minimizing the distance (intuitively, information loss) between a reconstruction and an input, where the reconstruction is now computed by random sampling from an input's latent space distributon** - which is why we needed a normally distributed latent space in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had not imposed a regularization term on a VAE's encoder layers, it would ultimately learn to minimize the decoder layer's reconstruction term by simply encoding distributions of near-zero variance and/or very different means - essentially, encoding points in the latent space - and the VAE degenerates to the vanilla autoencoder. **Enforcing a standard normally distributed latent space regularizes the mean and covariance matrix of distributions in the encoded latent space, avoiding overfitting to an input as the vanilla autoencoder is trained to do.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The RNN, Seq2Seq, and Gradient Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder-decoder paradigm, in practice is implemented as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), commonly with long-short-term-memory (LSTM) cells to deal with the vanishing/exploding gradient problem - this is the modern squence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. The seq2seq model usually employs an LSTM-RNN network to encode a variable length input sequence into a vector latent space representation, and an LSTM-RNN to decode that vector into a variable length output sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs encode a hidden state for each input of a given sequence. A node (or neuron) in the RNN takes each input in the sequence, adds it to the hidden state computed from the input before it, and computes a new hidden state through an activation function such as tanh. This process is repeated for all time steps for a given sequence, so the hidden state of each time step is computed on the aggregated hidden states of inputs before it. Only the last neuron's aggregated hidden state is passed to the decoding network.\n",

    "**The issue in this structure is that we can only calculate error for the final neuron's output - so each neurons' error depends on neurons at all time steps ahead of it. The of the final neuron must be backpropogated to all neurons in the same layer, not just to neurons in previous layers.** If the error of the final neuron is small (<1), it will become increasingly smaller and \"vanish\" as it is backpropogated multiplicatively at each time step. Similarly for a large error (>1), it will become increasingly large and \"explode\". **The RNN network will either not learn, or will take forever to learn - \n",

    "## LSTMs and Bidirectional RNNs\n",
    "One mechanism to alleviate the gradient problems of an RNN is the long short term memory (LSTM) cell. Intuitively, the LSTM\n",
    "cell is added to each node/neuron/time-step of an RNN and 'forgets' or 'remembers' hidden states - in essence, bypassing certain neurons in a sequence of time steps. An LSTM cell boils down to a combination of switch gates on each neuron - allowing a node in an RNN to remove or add information to the node, but often allowing informaiton to flow through unchanged.\n",

    "<center><sub>LSTM Cell from Christopher Olah's blog: https://colah.github.io/</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another optimization on top of the LSTM-RNN is to make it bidirectional: we stack two RNNs together, where the input sequence flows forward through one RNN and backward through the other. **At each time step the input is given simultaneously to two RNN neurons running opposite directions to eachother.** Each RNN aggregates its own hidden states, one forward and one in reverse. The hidden states are not shared between the two networks of a bidirectional RNN, but rather after the entire input sequence is consumed, the final hidden state of both the forward and reverse RNN is combined and then passed to the decoder network. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Attention Mechanism\n",
    "Introduced by Bahdanau et al in 2015 in their paper [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473). **The attention mechanism introduces weights between all hidden states of an encoder RNN and the original input sequence using an attention layer, a simple feedforward network.** The attention layer uses \"alignment weights\" to compute the contribution of each input's hidden state to the final hidden state - also known as the context vector in the attention mechanism - which is then passed to the decoder network. For each term predicted by the decoder for the output sequence, the attention layer computes a probability distribution over all hidden states of the input. **In other words, each term in the output sequence is computed from a unique context vector from the distribution computed by the attention layer. Each context vector is an alignment-weighted sum of hidden states computed by an LSTM-RNN from an input sequence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention layer is in contrast to a regular encoder-decoder RNN pair, which only uses one hidden state to generate the decoder's entire output sequence and just one hiddden state to backpropogate error. **The attention layer uses all hidden states to propogate error to all neurons of the encoder-decoder RNN simultaneously.**\n",

    "</sub></center>\n",
    " \n",
    "In a sense, the attention mechanism is kind of like ResNet's skip connections: instead, we skip the contribution of neurons in an RNN layer. The skip, or shortcut connections in an attention layer are those between individual hidden states and the final context vector."

Let's ignore maxpooling to understand the impact of channel dimensions: In the first layer of this network, a 1x128x563 input volume becomes a 16x128x563 output volume which is fed into the next convolutional layer with a 32-kernel filter, producing a 32x128x563 output volume. The 3rd and final layer has a 64-kernel filter and produces a 64x128x563 output volume. Each kernel learns weights for the convolution it produces, so each filter is a set of depth x height x width weights - for example, the final layer contains 32-kernel filters, and it produces 64 such filters to satisfy its output volume of  64x128x563.\n",

The size of all kernels in all layers in both convolutional blocks are 3x3 with stride 1 in this architecture. \n",

    "## Smoothing the Optimization Surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from batch normalization, other methods for taming optimization surface include skip connections, where a layer's outputs skip some of its subsequent layers - so implemented by the extremely successful ResNet (residiual network) architechture - taking inspiration from certain cells in the cerebral cortex. Such skip connections require a weight matrix of their own to be effective if skipping over more than one nonlinear layer. Local minima worse than the global minima become shallower, i.e. their depth decreases and this eliminates \"bad\" local minima in the loss landsacpe. \n",
    "\n",
    "The loss landsacpe is formed by the loss function over the training samples and training weights.

Deeper loss surfaces allows more flexibility in a model - for CNNs, that means the ability to learn higher level features built on outputs of previous layers, though but at the same time high-depth optimization landscape encourage overfitting to noise. In contrast, width smooths the optimization landscape and eliminates many bad local minima. We seek to find a balance in the width and depth of the optimization surface and ultimately make it as close to a convex function as possible."
