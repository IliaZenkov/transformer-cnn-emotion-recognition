    "# Speech Emotion Recognition with CNNs and Transformer: A Parallel Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, I'm going to build upon my [Intro to Speech Audio Classification repo](https://github.com/IliaZenkov/sklearn-audio-classification) and build a convolutional neural network (CNN) stacked in parallel with a Transformer encoder-decoder network to classify audio data. We're working on the [RAVDESS dataset](https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/) to classify emotions from one of 8 classes.** \n",
    "\n",
    "From my previous notebook: \"Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent DNN candidates for audio data classification: LSTM RNNs because of their excellent ability to interpret sequential data such as the audio waveform represented as a time series; CNNs because features engineered on audio data such as spectrograms have marked resemblance to images, in which CNNs excel at recognizing and discriminating between distinct patterns.\" - Me \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to build on that - CNNs are still the hallmark of image classification today, although even in this domain Transformers are beginning to take the main stage: A [2021 ICLR submission: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy) claims they've implemented a Transformer for image classification that outperforms a state of the art CNN, and at a much lower computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to taking inspiration from the above, it's also no longer 2015 - so **as the successor of the LSTM-RNN I'm going to implemenet a Transformer model in parallel with a CNN to try and get sorta-state-of-the-art performance on the RAVDESS dataset.** Let's get to it."

    "## Augmenting the Data: Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our dataset is small, it is prone to overfitting - especially with highly parameterized deep neural net models\n",
    "such as the one we aim to build in this notebook. As such, we're going to want to augment our data. Generating more real samples will be immensely difficult. Instead, we can add white noise to the audio signals - not only to mask the effect of random noise present in the training set - but also **to create pseudo-new training samples and offset the impact of noise intrinsic to the dataset.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the RAVDESS dataset is extremely clean - we will likely want to make predictions on noisy, real-world data - yet another reason to augment the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). It's Additive because we're adding it to the source audio signal,\n",
    "**it's Gaussian because the noise vector will be sampled from a normal distribution and have a time average of zero (zero-mean), and it's white because after a whitening transformation the noise will add power to the audio signal uniformly across the frequency distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a good balance of noise - too little will be useless, and too much will make it too difficult for the network to learn from the training data. **Note that this is just for training - we would _not_ need to add AWGN to real-world data on which we make predictions** (although we could). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Math\n",
    "The key parameters in AWGN are the signal to noise ratio (SNR), defining the magnitude of the noise added w.r.t. the audio signal. We parameterize AWGN with the minimum and maximize SNR so we can pick a random SNR to use in augmenting each sample's waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to constrain covariance to make it true AWGN. **We make a zero-mean vector of Gaussian noises (np.random.normal) that are statistically dependent. We need to apply a [whitening transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_transformation)**, a linear transformation taking a vector of random normal (Gaussian) variables with a known covariance matrix and mapping it to a new vector whose covariance is the identity matrix, i.e. the vector is now perfectly uncorrelated with a diaganol covariance matrix, each point of noise having variance == stdev == 1. **The whitening transformation by definition transforms a vector into a white noise vector.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to add the AWGN augmented waveforms as new samples to our dataset. **Since we generate AWGN which is random for each and every sample - random random noise - we can add multiples of our noise-augmented dataset. I'll add 2 extra identical, randomly noisy datasets with 1440 samples each to get a dataset with 1440 native + 1440x2 == 4320 noisy samples.**"

    "## Max Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "max pooling is a kind of dimensionality reduction technique: it down-samples inputs features , maxpooling in particular uses the maximum of each convolution window which creates a new pooled feature map, i.e. for maxpooling taking into the account the most prominent features of the layer maxpooling reduces the number of parameters a network learns as the connection between sequential layers contains fewer weights because of the reduced dimension in the maxpooled feature map - so computational complexity is drastically reduced. We compute feature map of a convlutional layer with overlapping windowsIf but we maxpool non-overlapping windows based on that feature map to create a down-sampled feature map. intuitively, maxpooling creates a featuremap that takes  the most important feature in each region of the input feature space and puts it in context of its position relative to other most important features near that region - i.e. an eye near a nose near a mouth probably means a face - doesn't matter the position of the eye, it just matters that it's adjacent to the nose and the nose to the mouth. Similarly, a sharp pitch transition from one mel frequency band to another means we have an angry voice, doesn't matter if the transition happens at a certain point in time.  a 2x2 maxpool kernel keeps 1/4 values, so we reduce the number of parameters for that layer's output feature map by 75%.  In practice the inventor of maxpooling says \"it is almost a shame that it works, because we really don't know why\" (TWIML AI podcast episode ##) but it improves generalizability greatly. \n",

    "## Kernels and Filters\n",
    "kernels - kernels of the convolutional layer are in analogy to neurons in a fully-connected layer. Each kernel contains a number of weights equal to its size (i.e. depth x height x width). The kernel's size is a hyperparameter of the convolutional layer which is called its receptive field, since the kernel's size determines the dimensions of the input features it operates on. We take the products of the kernel's weights with the values of the input feature map and sum them to create a single entry in the output feature map. In this task, the first input feature map has values describing pixel brightness - in our case, we have 128x563 \"spectrogram pixels\", each pixel representing the intensity in decibels of each of 128 mel frequencies at each of 563 time points - in other words, we have a 128x563 grayscale image map with just one channel for brightness.  Each kernel constituting a convolutional layer's filter creates a single feature map - so more kernels = more feature maps. If our input feature map has 1 channel and 2D dimension H x W, and we want 16 output channels, we'll have 1 kernel in that layer's filter and produce 16 feature maps of H x W, or a single 16 x H x W feature map for the entire layer. In short, a higher output channel dimension creates a larger, more complicated output feature map. This may be beneficial or detrimental w.r.t. overfitting depending on the task. \n",

    "A 3x3 kernel with stride 1 on our input 128x563 will produce a 126x561 feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider a collection of 2D kernels to create a 3D filter which defines a convolutional layer. For every input channel we have one 2D kernel, or for a multiple of input channels we have a collection of 2D kernels - i.e. a 3D filter. Each 2D kernel  creates a single contribution to one output channel - or the entire 3D filter creates one entire output channel. In the case where we expand the number of channels, i.e. expanding the complexity of the feature map in the channel/depth dimension while keeping constants it H x W dimensions. Each 3D filter is passed over the input feature map once for every complete output channel. To summarize, the number of inpuit channels determines the number of 2D kernels and thus, size of the entire layer's 3D filter, while the number of output channels determines how many filters are passed over the image - one unique 3D filter is required to create one unique output channel. Therefore, the input channel dimension determines the _size_ of the 3D filter in that convolutional layer, while the output channel dimension determines the _number_ of 3D filters in that layer. Each filter is defined by a unique set of weights, and each filter has its own bias term. In this way, we can think of each filter as a neuron of a convolutional layer. Each filter learns to represent a particular feature from the input feature map to the layer to which the filter belongs. Each filter creates a unique feature map. (In sum, the number of unique 2D kernels in a layer is equal to the number of input feature maps - the input channel dimension - and the number of unique 3D filters is equal to the number of output feature maps - the output channel dimension/ In sum, the number of input feature maps (input channel dimension) determines the number of unique 2D kernels, while the number of output feature maps (output channel dimension) determines the number of 3D filters.) This paradigm means that the convolutional layers actually perform a sort of feature extraction - they create high-order feature representations - and the classification is only done by subsequent non-convolutional layers, such as a fully connected linear layer.   Every layer of a ConvNet transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations\n",

    " #typical maxpool kernel == stride == 2 - higher kernel throws away more informaiton and smaller kernel retains more, since it will take more steps over the input feature map. Some prominent networks (AlexNet, GoogleNet) use 3x3 kernels with stride length 2 for their maxpooling layers. I played around with maxpool layer combinations throughout the network of size 2x2, stride 2, up to 4x4, stride 4. The guiding principal was to try and find a decent balance of feature retention at each layer of the network. I found that a 2x2 non-overlapping maxpool kernel is necessary on the input layer to retain a decent balance of features going through subsequent convolutional layers, and thereafter a non-overlapping 4x4, stride 4 kernel - a 1/16 feature map reduction - provided an excellent computation boost on the 3 convolutional layers thereafter  with little trade-off in accuracy. Larger kernels on the convolutional layer usually provides better feature representations - more complex feature maps - as it provides (??)\n",

So in first layer we apply a 3x3 kernel to the 2D spectrogram image space, subsequent layers will apply 16 x 3x3 kernels, or a single 16x3x3 kernel - i.e. the (16,128,563) feature map is convolved with a (16,3,3) filter in that layer - however the stride remains in the h,w dimension, we take all the weights in the depth (16) dimension. We can think of each convolutional layer having out_channel (e.g. 16) number of in_channels x height x width kernels each with 3x3 weights, each of 16 1x3x3 kernels being applied to each of 16 1x128x563 input channel separately - after maxpooling, we get 16x128/4x563/4 (plus zero padding) filters. . In other words, the number of 2D filters matches the number of input channels.

If our stride length is > 1, this means we will potentially lose features at the right and bottom edge of our feature map. Zero padding is standard in convolutional layers even with a stride of 1 - if we don't pad in this case, corner pixels (features) will only be used once. \n",

    "### Dropout and Pruning\n",
    "With dropout, we simply deactivate a number of neurons from each layer of our network, each neuron having a probability p to be deactivated 1-p to be kept. In this network we implement dropout of 30% of features at the end of each 2D convolutional layer after maxpooling the relu transformed outputs.  [the OG read on dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580). The resulting activations are scaled by 1/(1-p) so that the weights are appropriately scaled i.e. not inflated for those activations that are kept so the same network with no dropout is used on test data. so we keep the sum of the weights the same when using dropouts,  so we produce the same expected value of activations  independent of dropout probability - otherwise the activaitons from the kept neurons would cause incorrect weights to be learned. Anyway, dropout is preetty simple and applicable to a wide variety of neural network architectures. Think of it as kind of a \"weight loss\" for your network, pun intended - making the network faster - during training. **We turn off dropout (i.e. we keep all learned neurons) for validation and training.** \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to turn off certain neurons during validation and training, that would no longer be considered dropout - that would be pruning, where we look for and remove all connections with \"dead\" neurons - those with little contribution or otherwise undesirable contributions to the network. When we perform pruning on a network, we would be removing certain clusters of neurons - feature representations, i.e. filters from a CNN. There's been some recent progress in the field of CNN pruning with some pretty exciting results - for example, a [60% reduction in network parameters with a 0.6% accuracy loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08142)\n",

    "### Batch Normalization, Internal Covariate Shift, and Optimizing the Optimization Surface \n",
    "each layers net input distribution changes as the network is trained because the previous layer's output changes when its parameters are adjusted. non saturating nonlinearity is highly affected by weights of higher magnitude while saturating nonlinearities may make a model slower to train (beacuse large weights will be squshed?) - because the differential of a saturating non-linearity activation for outputs beyond +-1 approaches 0, the error differential between such outputs also approaches zero meaning no change to backpropogation for such outputs - i.e. we encounter a variation of the vanishing gradient problem. batch normalizing re-centers or re-normalizes the data so to speak so features always belong to similar distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "because of these changing net input distributions, the loss surface of the optimizer becomes more volatile as its loss surface is defined for  setting of the weights which will change in unpredictable ways on unstable net inputs - i.e. the loss manifold . As such,  lower learning rates are needed to ensure weights are moved in the direction of a more stable negative gradient, otherwise it is more likely to converge on suboptimal solutions before proper model parameters are learned. the parameter initialization is also important to consider in avoiding suboptimal convergence because it so. \n",
    "\n",
    "internal covariate shift is change in the distributon of network outputs (activations) due to the change in network parameters i.e. the shift in the output and parameter covariates. as output of each layer changes, the distribution of net inputs to all subsequent layers change - so the difficulty for each layer becomes attempting to model a changing distibution of net inputs. batch normalization attempts to make the net input distribution to each hidden layer similar throughout training. e.g. covariate shift:  input features sacled to have zero mean and unit variance, but once being output as activations of the subsequent hidden layer different features sets may now belong to different distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "the vanishing gradient problem is an issue with the saturating nonlinear sigmoid and tanh activation functions (outputs beyond +-1 are saturated) - batch normalization encourages each layer's neurons to produce outputs closer to the linear regions of their activationt, i.e. attempts to center the activation from the sigmoid function (to 0.5) and tanh function (to 0.)\n",
    "\n",
    " batch normalization is a technique to mitigate internal covariate shift. batch normlaization stabilizes the differential of distributions of internal (intermediate) activations, and this leads to faster convergence - BN steers the model away from becoming stuck in a saturated learning regime with a vanishing gradient. this normalization is implemented internally as an aspect of the model's architechture, so the output from each training minibatch is normalized at each layer. Since this mitigates the issue of internal covariate shift, the network can be initialized with a broader range of parameters and a higher learning rate and still achieve good accuracy. Batch normalization also regularizes learned coefficients in this way, discouraging  higher coefficients present in overfit models. The authors of the paper show by observation that batch normalization works, altghough they don't provide proof as to why.  The paper shows this empirically instead of with a mathematical proof - which is perhaps why some disagree with the reasoning behind BN:\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11604.pdf#:~:text=Batch%20Normalization%20(BatchNorm)%20is%20a,deep%20neural%20networks%20(DNNs).&text=This%20smoothness%20induces%20a%20more,gradients%2C%20allowing%20for%20faster%20training.) the authors argue that the stabilziation of the internal covariate shift (changing input distrubtions) is not the main factor behind BN's success, but rather it is smoothing of the optimizer's loss function landscape. a smoother loss surface creates a more stable direction of the gradient differential between each training step i.e. moving towards a good minima and the gradients are more predictable leading to faster training since we can use higher learning rates when the gradient moves predictably in the direction of a global minima, otherwise we would need frequent recalculation of the gradient in a region to make sure we move in the right direciton. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the default behaviour of batch norm and as it is implemented in pytorch is essentially applying standard scaling (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation) to the tensor's 2D minibatch dimension. (i.e. dim=2 and dim=3 in the N x C x H x W tensor format).  \n",
    "\n",

    "We're also using ReLU for activation, as is standard in CNN to avoid saturation of weights - large weights aren't squashed and we  further discourage a vanishing gradient. This model would take much longer to train with tanh/sigmoid with negligible performance increase. Especially important due to the moderate depth of this model, because with a saturating nonlinear activaiton we would have increasing difficulty trainig subsequent layers. We want a decent amount of layers to learn a higher representation of features, e.g. not just frequency transitions but the shape and magnitude of these transitions with respect to one another. gradient is usually high if a neuron is activated with ReLU, producing effective successive gradients in the network. Sigmoid and tanh produce near-zero gradients for very high magnitude inputs. relu is much cheaper han tanh or sigmoid because it computes max(0,input) vs the exponential in other nonlinear functions. All in all, ReLU will lead to much faster convergence and for this task produces excellent results. \n",

    "### More About the Optimization Surface\n",
    "other methods for taming optimization surface include skip connections, where a layer's outputs skip some of its subsequent layers - so implemented by the extremely successful ResNet (residiual network) architechture - taking inspiration from certain cells in the cerebral cortex. Such skip connections require a weight matrix of their own to be effective if skipping over more than one nonlinear layer. local minima worse htan the global minima become shallower, i.e. their depth decreases and this eliminates \"bad\" local minima in the loss landsacpe. \n",
    "(image of loss landsacpe with citation, difference with skip weights)\n",
    "the loss landsacpe is formed by the function L(weights) = avg of sum i to m training samples over L(xi, yi, weights) - (the surface is formed by each xi, yi, weight - however due to the high parameterization of neural networks the visual representation of the loss landscape is very high dimensional and not as simple, although the difference can be normalized to provide an intuitive understanding of loss as in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "depth of the loss function - practically, the degree of change coefficients will undergo due to the loss function's behaviour - allows more flexibility in a model and for CNNs, ultimately the ability to learn higher level features built on outputs of previous layers,  but at the same time encourages overfitting to noise. In contrast, width smoothes the optimization landscape and eliminates many bad local minima\n",

    "After our last convolutional layer produces its output feature maps - # output channels 2D feature maps, or one 3D feature map. since regular hidden layers operate only on 1D arrays, the entire feature map is flattened to a 1D array so it can be connected to all input neurons in the next fully connected layer, thusly termed - . In this network, we have an output \n",
    "\n",
    "using fully connected layer at the end of convolution as a standard architechture - takes the features with positions relative to eachother and processes them together. I.e. we have all these sets of mel frequency transitions in one feature map - the voice is angry. The FC layer operates on the combined feature map (a tensor) from the combined by the conv and transformer embeddings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "we have a parallel model where we pass the mel spec through a 4 layer transformer-encoder and 4 block 2d convolutional network at the same time to create activation tensors which we concatenate to form a single tensor which is then passed to the FC linear layer converting 320 features for all samples to 8 activations. \n",
    "\n",
    "the FC layer produces 8 activations (unnormalized logits) based on the activation maps/tensors produced by the filter of each convolutional layer. We need the  FC layer to combine higher-level features learnt by the end result of the convolution filters so that the network can build a global representation about the spectrogram - high level features may be present across different classes, but a specific combinaiton of these features more confidently represents an emotion. Another way to see this is the FC layer evaluates which of the high order features learned by the convolution filters is present in the current sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "each 2d block is like a LeNet architechture: Conv->relu>pool. The original 2015 BN paper suggests that \"We add the BN transform immediately before the nonlinearity\" i.e. before ReLU, but I found that I got better performance out of this architechture using BN after ReLU. **See Keras author's [Francois Chollet's response on GitHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/1802#issuecomment-187966878) regarding the BN order issue: \"I can guarantee that recent code written by Christian \\[Szegedy\\] but I can guarantee that recent code written by Christian applies relu before BN\".** \n",

    "VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”. The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. It was one of the famous model submitted to ILSVRC-2014. It makes the improvement over AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layer, respectively) with multiple 3×3 kernel-sized filters one after another. VGG16 was trained for weeks and was using NVIDIA Titan Black GPU’s.\n",

    "The input to cov1 layer is of fixed size 224 x 224 RGB image. The image is passed through a stack of convolutional (conv.) layers, where the filters were used with a very small receptive field: 3×3 (which is the smallest size to capture the notion of left/right, up/down, center). In one of the configurations, it also utilizes 1×1 convolution filters, which can be seen as a linear transformation of the input channels (followed by non-linearity). The convolution stride is fixed to 1 pixel; the spatial padding of conv. layer input is such that the spatial resolution is preserved after convolution, i.e. the padding is 1-pixel for 3×3 conv. layers. Spatial pooling is carried out by five max-pooling layers, which follow some of the conv.  layers (not all the conv. layers are followed by max-pooling). Max-pooling is performed over a 2×2 pixel window, with stride 2.\n",
